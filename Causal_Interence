# Beyond Correlation: A Practical Guide to Causal Inference in Data Science

## 1. Introduction: Why Causal Inference?
Hook: Correlation doesn’t mean causation — yet, in business, knowing what causes outcomes is critical.
Motivation: Making decisions (e.g., feature launches, marketing campaigns) requires causal understanding, not just patterns.
**Example**:: Ice cream sales & drowning rates correlation.

## 2. Correlation ≠ Causation
It's easy to mistake statistical associations for causal relationships. But making that leap without careful analysis can lead to poor business decisions.
Visual Idea: Side-by-side plot showing correlation between two unrelated variables 
- `Ice cream sales vs. drowning`
- `Cheese consumption vs. bedsheet entanglement deaths`

---

> These relationships are **spurious** — driven by hidden or confounding variables.

### 3. Key Terminology
| Term          | Definition                                       | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Treatment     | The intervention you're testing                  | Showing a discount offer     |
| Control group | The group that doesn't receive the treatment     | No offer shown               |
| Confounder    | A variable that affects both treatment & outcome | User location                |
| Randomization | Assigning treatment by chance                    | A/B testing users randomly   |
| Causal Effect | Difference in outcome due to treatment           | +5% conversions due to offer |

## Designing an Experiment (A/B Testing)

### ✅ Checklist:
- Define a clear hypothesis
- Randomly assign units (users, sessions)
- Ensure sufficient sample size
- Monitor confounders and avoid bias

# Measuring Causal Effect (ATE)

## Average Treatment Effect
 ATE = E|Y(1) - Y(0)|


##  When to Ship or Scrap?
# Decision Criteria:
Statistical Significance (e.g. p-value < 0.05)
Business Relevance (impact on KPIs)
Segment Robustness (works across user types)

# Optional Tools:
Bayesian A/B Testing
Uplift Modeling
Sequential Testing

## Beyond A/B: Observational Causal Inference
When RCTs (randomized controlled trials) aren't feasible (e.g., for pricing changes or geographic rollouts), use these methods:

- Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- Instrumental Variables (IV)
- Causal Forests / Double Machine Learning
